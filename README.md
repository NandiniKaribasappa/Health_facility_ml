Health Facility Machine Learning Project
This project involves end-to-end analysis of government health center data, including data engineering, relational table creation, feature preprocessing, and the development of a K-Means clustering model 
supported by PCA-based visualization. The objective is to transform raw public data into structured insights that can support healthcare planning and decision-making. 


Project Components:
Google Colab notebook with full workflow
Machine learning artifacts (KMeans model, Scaler, Encoder)
Cleaned and processed datasets
Ten analytical tables derived from source data
Final project report 
Clustered output dataset (health_facility_clusters.csv) and Output screenshots.


How to Run the Project:
Open the notebook in Google Colab.
Upload the original dataset or use the processed tables available in this repository.
Execute all cells in sequence to reproduce the full workflow.
Review the generated outputs, including cluster assignments, PCA visualization, and KPI summary.
Uploaded the Screenshots of dataset preview, cleaning, clustering, PCA visualization, and KPIs are available in output screenshot
